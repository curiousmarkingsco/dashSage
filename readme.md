# dashSage
Make your new tab page whatever you want it to be without writing any code.

## Features

- Uses Manifest v3
- Use npm dependencies thanks to Parcel 2.
- [Auto-syncing options](#auto-syncing-options).
- [Auto-publishing](#publishing) with auto-versioning and support for manual releases.

## Getting started

### üõ† Build locally

1. Checkout the copied repository to your local machine eg. with `git clone https://github.com/my-username/my-awesome-extension/`
1. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
1. Run `npm run build`

The build step will create the `distribution` folder, this folder will contain the generated extension.

### üèÉ Run the extension

Using [web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) is recommended for automatic reloading and running in a dedicated browser instance. Alternatively you can load the extension manually (see below).

1. Run `npm run watch` to watch for file changes and build continuously
1. Run `npm install --global web-ext` (only only for the first time)
1. In another terminal, run `web-ext run -t chromium`
1. Check that the extension is loaded by opening the extension options ([in Firefox](media/extension_options_firefox.png) or [in Chrome](media/extension_options_chrome.png)).

#### Manually

You can also [load the extension manually in Chrome](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/browser-extension-edge-chrome-firefox-opera-brave-vivaldi/#google-chrome-opera-vivaldi) or [Firefox](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/browser-extension-edge-chrome-firefox-opera-brave-vivaldi/#mozilla-firefox).

### ‚úèÔ∏è Make the first change

1. For example, edit source\manifest.json to `"name": "My Awesome Extension",`
1. Go back to your browser, reload and see the change take effect

Note: Firefox will automatically reload content scripts when the extension is updated, Chrome requires you to reload the page to reload the content scripts.

### üìï Read the documentation

Here are some websites you should refer to:

- [Parcel‚Äôs Web Extension transformer documentation](https://parceljs.org/recipes/web-extension/)
- [Chrome extensions‚Äô API list](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/)
- A lot more links in my [Awesome WebExtensions](https://github.com/fregante/Awesome-WebExtensions) list

## Configuration

The extension doesn't target any specific ECMAScript environment or provide any transpiling by default. The extensions output will be the same ECMAScript you write. This allows us to always target the latest browser version, which is a good practice you should be following.

### Parcel 2

Being based on Parcel 2 and its [WebExtension transformer](https://parceljs.org/recipes/web-extension/), you get all the good parts:

- Browserlist-based code transpiling (which defaults to just the latest Chrome and Firefox versions)
- Automatically picks up any new file specified in `manifest.json`

### Auto-syncing options

Options are managed by [fregante/webext-options-sync][link-options-sync], which auto-saves and auto-restores the options form, applies defaults and runs migrations.
